# Hello React (minimal)

This is a minimal "Hello, React!" app implemented as a single static `index.html` that loads React and ReactDOM from a CDN. No build step or Node.js is required to run it.

How to run

- Open `index.html` in your browser (double-click or use the browser "Open File" option).
- Or serve it from a simple static server, e.g. with Python 3:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 3000
# then open http://localhost:3000 in your browser
```

What you'll see

- A page with "Hello, React!" and a button that triggers an alert when clicked.

Notes

- This setup is suitable for demos and learning. For a real project, consider creating a full React app using Vite, Create React App, or similar tooling.
